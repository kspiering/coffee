     <h2>The Story in Every Sip</h2>

  <p>Coffee has a rich and fascinating history that dates back to 9th century Ethiopia, where a curious goat herder first noticed the energizing effects of coffee cherries. Today, coffee is the second most traded commodity in the world, right after crude oil, and comes in over a hundred plant species, with Arabica and Robusta being the most popular. Arabica is known for its smooth and mild flavor, while Robusta packs a stronger, more bitter punch with higher caffeine content.
A typical cup of coffee contains about 95 mg of caffeine, enough to lift your mood and sharpen your focus. Even decaf isn’t completely caffeine-free, containing a small 2–5 mg per cup. Moderate coffee consumption is also linked to health benefits, including lower risks of type 2 diabetes, Parkinson’s disease, and liver conditions.
Around the globe, coffee has become a cultural staple. Finland leads the world in per capita consumption, with each Finn enjoying over 12 kg of coffee per year. Historically, coffee houses were called “penny universities” in 17th century England, where a simple cup of coffee sparked lively conversation and learning.
Interestingly, coffee “beans” aren’t beans at all—they are the seeds of the coffee cherry fruit. And if you’re brewing at home, the perfect ratio is generally one part coffee to sixteen parts water. Coffee grows best in the region known as the Coffee Belt, lying between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn. Whether sipped as a smooth espresso or a comforting cup of drip coffee, it’s no wonder coffee continues to captivate people around the world.</p>
